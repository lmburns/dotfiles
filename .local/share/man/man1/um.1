.SH NAME
um \- Create your own man pages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBum\fP [\-t \fItopic\fP | \(emtopic \fItopic\fP] \fIpagename\fP 
.br
\fBum\fP [\-h | \(emhelp] [\-v | \(emversion] 
.br
\fBum\fP \fIsubcommand\fP [OPTIONS \.\.\.]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBum\fP helps you create and manage your own personal collection of man pages\. These custom man pages are called um pages, though by default they look exactly like man pages and are indeed viewed using the \fBman\fP utility\. You can record what you know about a command in an um page so that you can refer back to it later without wading through all the information in the offical man page for that command\.
.P
\fBum\fP can be invoked on its own or in conjunction with a subcommand\. Invoking \fBum\fP on its own is equivalent to invoking \fBum read\fP\&\. In this case, you must provide a \fIpagename\fP argument that tells \fBum\fP which page you want to display\.
.P
For more information about the available subcommands, refer to the SEE ALSO section below\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
These options are accepted by \fBum\fP when no subcommand is specified:
.TP
\-v, \(emversion
Display the version number, or \[u2018]unknown\[u2019] if the version is not known\.
.TP
\-h, \(emhelp
Display help information, including a list of subcommands\.
.TP
\-t, \(emtopic
Set the topic for this invocation of \fBum\fP\&\. \fBum\fP will then assume that \fIpagename\fP refers to a page under this topic\.
.SH "FILES"
\fBum\fP can be configured using a configuration file stored at \fB~/\.um/umconfig\fP\&\. See README\.md for more information about how to set configuration options\. See um\-config(1) for information about how to view the current configuration\.
.P
\fBum\fP can also make use of template files stored under \fB~/\.um\fP\&\. See README\.md for more information about template files\.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
See um\-config(1) for more information about the environment variables accessed by \fBum\fP\&\.
