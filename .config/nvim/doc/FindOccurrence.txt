DESCRIPTION					  *FindOccurrence-description*

This plugin adds the following features to the default Vim mappings for
|:isearch|, |:ilist| and |:ijump|:
- |]I| et al. not only list the occurrences, but ask for the occurrence number
  to jump to.
- |]I| et al. also work in visual mode, searching for the selection instead of
  the word under cursor.
- New |]n| |]N| |]<C-N>| |<C-W>n| |<C-W><C-N>| mappings that operate on the
  last search pattern.
- New |]/| |<C-W>/| mappings that query and then operate on a pattern.

SOURCE									     *

Based on the Vim Tip "Search visually":

USAGE							*FindOccurrence-usage*
	   *[I* *]I* *[_CTRL-I* *]_CTRL-I* *g[I* *g]I* *g[_CTRL-I* *g]_CTRL-I*
List occurrences of \<word\> under cursor / word under cursor (g[I) / visual
selection:
With any [count], also includes 'comment'ed lines.
[count][I		List all occurrences in the file. (Like |:ilist|)
[count]]I		List occurrences from the cursor position to end of
			file.
[count][CTRL-I		Jump to the [count]'th occurrence in the file. (Like
			|:ijump|)
[count]]CTRL-I		Jump to the [count]'th occurrence starting from the
			cursor position.

				     *[n* *]n* *[N* *]N* *[_CTRL-N* *]_CTRL-N*
List occurrences of last search pattern |quote/|:
With any [count], also includes 'comment'ed lines.
[count][n		List [count]'th occurrence in the file. (Like
			|:isearch|)
[count]]n		List [count]'th occurrence from the cursor position.
[count][N		List all occurrences in the file. (Like |:ilist|)
[count]]N		List occurrences from the cursor position to end of
			file.
[count][CTRL-N		Jump to the [count]'th occurrence in the file. (Like
			|:ijump|)
[count]]CTRL-N		Jump to the [count]'th occurrence starting from the
			cursor position.

							  *[/* *]/* *CTRL-W_/*
List occurrences of queried pattern:
With any [count], also includes 'comment'ed lines.
[count][/		Without [count]: Query, then list all occurrences in
			the file (like |:ilist|).
			With [count]: Query, then jump to [count]'th
			occurrence; if it doesn't exist, list all occurrences.
[count]]/		Without [count]: Query, then list occurrences from the
			cursor position to end of file.
			With [count]: Query, then jump to [count]'th
			occurrence from the cursor position; if it doesn't
			exist, list occurrences from the cursor position to
			end of file.
			These eclipse [/ and ]/ motions, but you can still use
			[* and ]*.
[count]CTRL-W_/		Query, then jump to the [count]'th occurrence in a
			split window.

							  *[?* *]?* *CTRL-W_?*
[count][?		Without [count]: List all occurrences of the
			previously queried pattern in the file (like
			|:ilist|).
			With [count]: Jump to [count]'th previously queried
			occurrence; if it doesn't exist, list all occurrences.
[count]]?		Without [count]: List occurrences of the previously
			queried pattern from the cursor position to end of
			file.
			With [count]: Jump to [count]'th previously queried
			occurrence from the cursor position; if it doesn't
			exist, list occurrences from the cursor position to
			end of file.
[count]CTRL-W_?		Jump to the [count]'th previously queried occurrence
			in a split window.

NOTES									     *

- The [ and <C-W> mappings start at the beginning of the file, the ] mappings
  at the line after the cursor. Both are directed forward, so it's easy to
  jump to the next match, but to go to a previous match, you have to find out
  about the match number and use that.
- Without a [count], commented lines are ignored. If you want to show the list
  that includes commented lines, use a high count (e.g. 999) that is unlikely
  to produce a direct match.
- x just echoes the occurrence, X prints a list of the occurrences and asks
  for the occurrence number to jump to, <C-X> directly jumps to the
  occurrence, <C-W>x and <C-W><C-X> split the window and jump to the
  occurrence.
- i I <Tab> <C-W>i <C-W><Tab> for word under cursor.
- d D <C-D> <C-W>d <C-W><C-D> for macro definition under cursor.
- n N <C-N> <C-W>n <C-W><C-N> for last search pattern.
- / <C-W>/                    for queried pattern.

USE CASES								     *

- List all occurrences excluding / including comments:
  [X / 999[X
- Move through all matches excluding / including comments:
  [CTRL-X, ]CTRL-X, ]CTRL-X, ... / 1[CTRL-X, 1]CTRL-X, 1]CTRL-X, ...
- Move through every n'th match excluding / including comments:
  [CTRL-X, ]Xn, ]Xn, ... / 1[CTRL-X, n]CTRL-X, n]CTRL-X, ...
