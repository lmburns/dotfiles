[keybindings]

# Keybindings must be an array of one or more strings.
# If you want to distinguish between a regular alphanumeric key
# and Shift+key, you can use the capital letter that you would normally
# type when pressing Shift+key (e.g., Shift+"r" will give you "R").

# Other special characters and their config string:
# Arrow keys: "Left", "Right", "Up", "Down"
# Ctrl+key: "C-key" (e.g., "C-r" means Ctrl+"r")
# Shift+key: "S-key" (e.g., "S-Del" means Shift+Delete)
# Insert ("Ins"), Delete ("Del"), Home ("Home"), End ("End"),
# Page up ("PgUp"), Page down ("PgDn"), Tab ("Tab")
# Enter ("Enter"), Escape ("Esc") -- be aware that on some terminals the
# Escape key waits for further input before passing it along to
# shellcaster, so you might notice a delay with this key

# Don't try to use backslash, or you're gonna have a bad time

[colors]

# Colors can be identified in three ways:
# 1. Using color names defined by your terminal:
#    - black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, or yellow
#    - The special color name "terminal" can also be used to specify
#      your terminal's default foreground or background color; this is
#      particularly useful if your terminal background is transparent --
#      use "terminal" for the background colors below.
# 2. Using a hex code in the format "#ff0000" or "#FF0000" to specify
#    RGB values.
# 3. Using an RGB value in the format "rgb(255, 0, 0)" where each number
#    is a value between 0 and 255.
# Note that, as might be expected, the ability to set colors depends on
# the capabilities of your terminal. Config options set below are ignored
# on terminals without the ability to add/change colors.
