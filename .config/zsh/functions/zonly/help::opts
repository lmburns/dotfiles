setting of option within that function) produces a warning and effect is cancelled."

(including this one) which were in force upon entry to function are restored; options that are not\n\
restored are PRIVILEGED and RESTRICTED. Otherwise, only this option, and LOCALLOOPS, XTRACE and\n\
PRINTEXITVALUE options are restored. Hence if this is explicitly unset by a shell function other\n\
options in force at point of return will remain so. A shell function can also guarantee itself\n\
a known shell configuration with a formulation like 'emulate -L zsh'; -L activates LOCALOPTIONS."
local_patterns        "If this option is set at point of return from a shell function, state of\n\
pattern disables, as set with the builtin command 'disable -p', is restored to what it was when\n\
function was entered. behaviour of this option is similar to effect of LOCALOPTIONS on options;\n\
hence 'emulate -L sh' (or indeed any other emulation with -L option) activates LOCALPATTERNS"
local_traps           "If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then\n\
previous status of trap for that signal will be restored when function exits. Note that this option\n\
must be set prior to altering trap behaviour in a function; unlike LOCALOPTIONS, value on exit from\n\
function is irrelevant. However, it does not need to be set before any global trap for that to be\n\
correctly restored by a function"
