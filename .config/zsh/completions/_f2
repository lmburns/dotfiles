arguments=(
  {-f,--find}'[search pattern. Treated as a regular expression by default unless --string-mode is also used. If omitted, it defaults to the entire file name (including the extension).]'
  {-r,--replace}'[replacement string. If omitted, defaults to an empty string. Supports built-in and regex capture variables. Learn more about variable support here: https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/wiki/Built-in-variables]'
  {-u,--undo}'[undo the last operation performed in the current working directory if possible. Learn more: https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/wiki/Undoing-a-renaming-operation]'
  {-l,--replace-limit}'[limit the number of replacements to be made on the file name (replaces all matches if set to 0). Can be set to a negative integer to start replacing from the end of the file name.]'
  {-s,--string-mode}'[opt into string literal mode. The presence of this flag causes the search pattern to be treated as a non-regex string.]'
  {-E,--exclude}'[exclude files/directories that match the given search pattern. Treated as a regular expression. Multiple exclude patterns can be specified.]'
  {-x,--exec}'[execute the batch renaming operation. This will commit the changes to your filesystem.]'
  {-R,--recursive}'[recursively traverse all directories when searching for matches. Use the --max-depth flag to control the maximum allowed depth (no limit by default).]'
  {-m,--max-depth}'[positive integer indicating the maximum depth for a recursive search (set to 0 for no limit).]'
  '--sort[sort the matches according to the provided <sort>.]'
